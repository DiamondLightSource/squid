## Getting Started

Assumptions and goals
This developer tool is for debugging bluesky plasn in the early phases, providing DAQ-focused, not scientist focused UI.
It is to serve the immediate needs for bluesky sprints for the SWIFT team.

We assume that the plans are with devices already injected and it's rare that we specify devices manually in the JS world.

## Beyond MVP cool features

Alternatively, devices fetched from `/devices` could be drag-and-droppable into the args area

We also assume that we manually specify params per plan but that commonly used plans will have a separate validated form.

json edition suggestions are also possible
